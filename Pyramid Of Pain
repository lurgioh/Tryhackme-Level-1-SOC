Pyramid Of Pain:
-Well-renowned concept is being applied to cybersecurity solutions like Cisco Security,
SentinelOne, and SOCRadar
-improves the effectiveness of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence)
-Understand it as a Threat Hunter, Incident Responder, or SOC Analyst

Hash Values
-MD5 (Message Digest, defined by RFC 1321): was designed by Ron Rivest in 1992 and is a widely used cryptographic hash function
with a 128-bit hash value. MD5 hashes are NOT considered cryptographically secure. Attacks against MD5 hashes, include hash collision
-SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1, defined by RFC 3174 was invented by United States National Security Agency in 1995. 
-SHA-1 takes an input and produces in 160 bit hash value string as a 40 digit hexadecimal signatures. 
-SHA-1 was later banned in 2013 based on it being susceptible to brute force attacts. 
-NIST recommeneds migrating from SHA-1 to stronger hash algorithms in the SHA-2 and 3 families
-Security professionals usually use the hash values to gain insight into specific malware, a molicious or suspicious file,
and as a way to uniquely identify and reference the malicious artifact
-An attacker can modify a file even by a single bit which can produce a different hash value
-With many variations and istances of known malware or ransomeware, threat hunting using file hashes as the IOC (Indicators of Compromise)
can become difficult

IP Address
-IP Address is used to idnetify any device connected to a network
-Devices can range from CCTV cameras, desktops, and servers
-Knowing IP addresses are a valuable assest as you can use common defense tatics to block, drop, or deny inbound requests from IP addresses on parameter or external firewall
-One way an adversay can make it challenging to successfully carry out IP blocking is by using Fast Flux
-According to Akamai, Fast Flux is a DNS technique use by botnets to hide phishing, web proxying, malware delivery, and malware communication activities behind compromised hosts acting as a proxy
-The purpose of FAst Flux is to make communication between malware and its command and control server (C&C) challenging to be discovered
