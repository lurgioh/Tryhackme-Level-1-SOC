Pyramid Of Pain:
-Well-renowned concept is being applied to cybersecurity solutions like Cisco Security,
SentinelOne, and SOCRadar
-improves the effectiveness of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence)
-Understand it as a Threat Hunter, Incident Responder, or SOC Analyst

Hash Values
-MD5 (Message Digest, defined by RFC 1321): was designed by Ron Rivest in 1992 and is a widely used cryptographic hash function
with a 128-bit hash value. MD5 hashes are NOT considered cryptographically secure. Attacks against MD5 hashes, include hash collision
-SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1, defined by RFC 3174 was invented by United States National Security Agency in 1995. 
-SHA-1 takes an input and produces in 160 bit hash value string as a 40 digit hexadecimal signatures. 
-SHA-1 was later banned in 2013 based on it being susceptible to brute force attacts. 
-NIST recommeneds migrating from SHA-1 to stronger hash algorithms in the SHA-2 and 3 families
-Security professionals usually use the hash values to gain insight into specific malware, a molicious or suspicious file,
and as a way to uniquely identify and reference the malicious artifact
