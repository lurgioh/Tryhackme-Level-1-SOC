## ✅ What I'm Doing

I am actively completing rooms and exercises designed to simulate the real-world tasks of a Tier 1 SOC Analyst. These include:

- Learning the fundamentals of networking, SIEM, and threat intelligence
- Practicing log analysis and alert triage using Splunk and Elastic
- Working with MITRE ATT&CK, Wireshark, Sigma rules, and common SOC tools
- Gaining exposure to phishing investigations and malware analysis basics
- Building a professional lab workflow using Kali Linux and Windows VMs

## 💼 Documentation Style

For each room I complete, I create a markdown file that includes:

- Room overview and learning objectives
- Key commands, concepts, and techniques
- Screenshots or diagrams (where needed)
- Personal takeaways and lessons learned
